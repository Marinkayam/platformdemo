**Design System** - The design system is defined under the `src/components/ui` and it contains basic components for building pages.
**Design System Playground** - there is a playground that simulates storybook and is under the `src/pages/DesignSystemPlayground.tsx` file. This is where you can find how to use the different components from the design system. 

Every time that in chat you alter or create code and you use something from the design system, use a purple heart at the beginning and end of the message in the chat to indicate that you did so.
